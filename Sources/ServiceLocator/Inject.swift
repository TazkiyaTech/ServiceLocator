/// A convenience property wrapper which makes it easier to pull out services from a `ServiceLocator` object.
///
/// Without this property wrapper, you would define properties in your `UIViewController` and `XCTestCase` classes as follows:
///
/// ```
/// var someService: SomeService {
///     try! serviceLocator.getServiceOfType(SomeService.self)
/// }
/// ```
/// With this property wrapper, you can instead define properties as a one-liner as follows:
///
/// ```
/// @Inject(via: serviceLocator) var someService: SomeService
/// ```
///
